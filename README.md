# ZK SNARK Designer
## Circum Circuit
To implement a zkSNARK circuit that proves you know the inputs A (0) and B (1) that yield a 0 output, we'll use the circom programming language to define the circuit and then use ZoKrates to generate the proof and verification keys. Finally, we'll deploy a verifier smart contract on-chain to verify the proofs generated by the zkSNARK circuit.

## Description
This project implements a logical gate circuit using the circom programming language. The circuit implements the following truth table:

A B X Y Q

0 0 0 1 1

0 1 0 0 0

1 0 0 1 1

1 1 1 0 1

## Project Implementation
1. Write a correct circuit.circom implementation.
2. Compile the circuit to generate circuit intermediaries.
3. Generate a proof using inputs A=0 B=1.
4. Deploy a solidity verifier to Goerli/Mumbai Testnet.
5. Call the verifyProof() method on the verifier contract and assert output is true.

## Step 
Step 1: Start by installing the necessary dependencies with the command npm install.
Step 2: Proceed to make updates to the Hardhat Configuration File.
Step 3: Compile the contract by running npx hardhat compile.
Step 4: Execute the contract deployment using the command npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts.
Step 5: Confirm the Deployment:
Once the contract has been successfully deployed, the deploy.ts script should display "true" in the terminal to indicate a successful deployment. In case of any difficulties, it's important to double-check both your contract code and the configuration settings in your Hardhat setup.
