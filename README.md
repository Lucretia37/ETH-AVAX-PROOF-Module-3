# ZK SNARK  
## Circum Circuit
To create a zkSNARK circuit that demonstrates knowledge of inputs A (0) and B (1), resulting in an output of 0, we will utilize the circom programming language for circuit definition. We'll then employ ZoKrates to produce the necessary proof and verification keys. Ultimately, our goal is to deploy a smart contract on the blockchain for verification purposes, ensuring the validity of proofs generated by the zkSNARK circuit.

## Description
This project implements a logical gate circuit using the circom programming language.  
 

## Project Implementation
1.Craft a precise implementation of the circuit in the circom language.
2.Proceed to compile the circuit, producing the necessary intermediate files.
3.Create a proof by supplying input values of A=0 and B=1.
4.Deploy a verifier contract written in Solidity onto the Goerli or Mumbai Testnet.
5.Invoke the verifyProof() function within the deployed verifier contract and confirm that the output evaluates to true.

## Step 
Step 1: Start by installing the necessary dependencies with the command npm install.
Step 2: Proceed to make updates to the Hardhat Configuration File.
Step 3: Compile the contract by running npx hardhat compile.
Step 4: Execute the contract deployment using the command npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts.
Step 5: Confirm the Deployment:
Once the contract has been successfully deployed, the deploy.ts script should display "true" in the terminal to indicate a successful deployment. In case of any difficulties, it's important to double-check both your contract code and the configuration settings in your Hardhat setup.
